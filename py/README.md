### Package Requirements:
- `graphviz`
- `plotly==4.6.0`
- `country_converter`


**Notes**:
If you are using a `conda` environment, use `conda activate {env}` and `conda install {package}` to install the packages. Alternatively, you can use `python virualenv` with `pip install` to get the program run properly.



### Data:
---
If you are having trouble to access our data, go to [data](https://github.com/Benjaminnnnnn/CSE-163-FINAL-PROJECT/tree/master/data).



### Program Behaviors:
---
Since we are using `plotly`, every plots produced by it will open up a new `localhost` page, and you can view the plots there. For other plots produced by `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `graphviz`, the program will search for a folder named **img**, and write the plots to that folder (so make sure to have a folder called **img**).

For the **analysis** part, we separate our program into four different functions corresponding to each research questions. If there is anything error when running the program, try to restart the terminal or whatever tools for running the python module (sometimes `plotly` is weird and that happened to my teammates as well), if it's still not working, try to reinstall `plotly`. Make sure the `plotly` version is `4.6.0` since older version is not compatible with our code.


:tada: **Thanks for all the good work this quarter, TAs!**
